# Introduction to Circuit Design and Spice Simulations

## Lecture 1:- Why do we need SPICE simulations?
- All the logic gates such as NAND, NOR, OR, AND etc are implemented at the transistor level using combinations of PMOS (p-channel MOSFET) and NMOS (n-channel MOSFET) devices arranged in specific configurations. They perform their required functionality of that particular respective gate. Example- Inverter.

This circuit is fed with some wavefrom to identify the output response, the characteristic curve of this circuit decide the delay and based on that delay we will get the W/L ratio of the particular transistor using SPICE simulation.

## WHy do we need SPICE?
-The physical design flow, clock tree synthesis, crosstalks, and timing are built on SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis),it allows designers to analyze, verify, and optimize a circuit’s performance using delay tables before physical fabrication.

-Assume that the given circuit has undergone Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), where multiple clock buffers have been inserted throughout the design. These buffers are sized appropriately to drive varying capacitive loads at different output nodes, ensuring balanced clock distribution and controlled skew across the network.

- We receive a "Delay Table" with input slew and output load following the SPICE simulation. 
- Delay is defined as the intersection of the input slew and output load values. 
- There are delay tables displayed for both level 1 and level 2 buffers. This is calculated by circuit design and simulation.

The circuit design process employing SPICE simulations is the source of the delay tables seen above. Characterization of any CMOS logic is part of SPICE simulations.
- Due to lower drive and higher drive of 

## Lecture 2:- Introduction to basic element in circuit design-NMOS
-An NMOS transistor is a four-terminal device built on lightly doped p-type substrate, with two heavily doped n-type regions which are source and drain . The isolation region isolate the transistor from other transistor,There is a thin gate oxide layer of Silicon Dioxide separates gate from semiconductor and prevents direct current flow and above it metal or Polysilicon is deposited which is the gate terminal.

## Threshold Voltage (Vt)
Threshold voltage is the minimum gate-to-source voltage required to create a conducting channel in an NMOS transistor. It determines when the device turns ON and controls current flow, switching speed, and power consumption.
## Threshold Voltage Modelling
- Let Vgs=0
- Drain, Source and Body is connected to GND
- Substrate-Source(B-S) and Substrate-Drain(B-D) form p-n junction diodes
- Both junctions are OFF, no conduction path between source and drain hence Source-Drain resistance is High

**When small voltage is applied(Vgs<Vth)**
<img width="763" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be0b6d73-a480-4b08-83c4-b003a61c4566" />
- Positive charges appears on gate
- An electric field is created from gate toward substrate
- It forms oxide capacitor, holes(majority carriers in P-substrate) are pushed away from substrate
- Fixed negative acceptors ions remain near to the surface

- Due to negative charges accumulation, a depletion layer forms under the gate where majority carriers are delpeted.

## Lecture 3:- Strong Inversion
**When we increase the gate voltage(Vgs=Vth)**
<img width="769" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c479621c-5c1f-49c9-bc3c-0cfe98084bea" />

- Width of the depletion region increases
- More number of electrones accumalate at the surface
- Finally it reached at a point where the surface region of the substrate gets completely inverted to n-type material which is known as inversion layer.This is called **strong inversion** or **surface inversion**.

**When we increase the gate voltage further(Vgs>Vth)**

- Large number of electrons are accumulated the surface
- The positive potential of the gate area attract the negative charge particle from the n+ source area like a magnet
- Channel width get increased and no change of the depletion layer width

- There will be a point at which a continuous n-channel formation from Source to Drain, posibility of current flow whose conductivity is modulated by Vgs
- Initially Vgs=0, the Source to Drain resistance is so high, there was absolutely zero current flow
